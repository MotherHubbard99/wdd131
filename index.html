          <div class="about-me-grid">
              <p>Hello! My name is Angie Hubbard and I live in South Weber, Utah, USA. I am currently a stay-at-home mom who works tax season, from January through April, each year. My husband and I have a blended family with 7 children. We have 3 married children and two grandpuppies. Our youngest is 8 and she is the child we share together who makes the sweet icing on our family cake. We have an XL sized bernese mountain dog, named Clark, who weighs a whopping 150 pounds. We also have a 13 pound cavapoo who is our mini dog.  We love to take our dogs hiking and on walks with us.
